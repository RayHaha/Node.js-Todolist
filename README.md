# Node.js-Todolist
practice node.js (or MEAN stack) by programming a todo list

Requirement:

1. A user can add, edit, and delete "todos"
2. Each todo can be marked as complete
3. Each todo can have one optional file attachment
4. One person cannot access the todos of another

Now I've built the web API. In the future, I can build different kinds of web application. Maybe AngularJS, IOS or Android that uses the API to update, read, create, delete todos that are stored in the database. We can even have multiple platforms or front-ends.
Creating the API first expands the options for the future.
I've already used the postman to check the APIs.
